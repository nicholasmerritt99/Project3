# mission: Rescue

mission: <strong>rescue</strong> will be the victims abuse help site hidden in plain sight with the goal of providing real help and information to users.

The users will access the site via a button which can be imbedded onto any website. 
Upon access to the site, the user will be prompted with a login/sign up page.
Once granted permission to the site various tabs of imformation are available for the user to explore.
If the user feels uncomfortable or in danger of someone watching over their shoulder there is a double click escape where the user can double click anywhere on the window and the window will switch from our site to google and pinterest.
