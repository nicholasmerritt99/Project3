								<br>•    Keep change with you at all times.
								<br>•    Memorize all important numbers.
								<br>•    Establish a “code word” or “sign” so that family, friends, teachers or co-workers know when to call for help.
								<br>•    Think about what you will say to your partner if he/she becomes violent.
								<br>Remember, you have the right to live without fear and violence.
								<br><br>
								<strong>If you have left the relationship:</strong>
								<br>•    Change your phone number.
								<br>•    Screen calls.
								<br>•    Save and document all contacts, messages, injuries or other incidents involving the batterer.
								<br>•    Change locks, if the batterer has a key.
								<br>•    Avoid staying alone.
								<br>•    Plan how to get away if confronted by an abusive partner.
								<br>•    If you have to meet your partner, do it in a public place.
								<br>•    Vary your routine.
								<br>•    Notify school and work contacts.
								<br>•    Call a shelter<br>
